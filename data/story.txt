The Unbelievable Chronicles of Reginald Thistlewhiskers: Pizza, Peril, and Peculiar Pals

In the heart of Willowbrook Valley, nestled between the Mossy Maple Woods and the babbling Pebblecreek, lived Reginald Thistlewhiskers, an intrepid rabbit born on the Leap Day of 2012 (February 29th, a very rare birthday among rabbits, which made him both lucky and, some said, a little magical). Reginald Thistlewhiskers was no ordinary rabbit. Born under a full moon in the legendary Burrow of Bumberscratch, Reginald had always been destined for greatness—or at least for mild mischief. Unlike his siblings, who dreamed of someday starring in the annual Willowbrook Carrot Festival, Reginald wanted to explore the unknown, taste every food, and invent a dance craze (his signature move was called “the Hop-and-Scoot”).

Reginald’s mother, Lady Penelope Thistlewhiskers, was known as the “Carrot Queen,” and his father, Lord Oliver Thistlewhiskers, held the unofficial title of “Earl of Lettuce.” Reginald had twelve siblings: the twins Basil and Sage, the ever-sleepy Parsnip, the triplets Thistle, Clover, and Dandelion, and the mischievous youngest, Pippin, who once tried to build a jetpack out of soda bottles.

The Burrow of Bumberscratch was an old warren, its entrance hidden behind a patch of wild violets. The rabbit world extended far beyond Bumberscratch. There was Snailstone Hill, a grassy knoll where the ancient council of snails convened every Monday at 4 p.m. sharp. Parsley Pond was home to the world-renowned synchronized swimming frog team, the Amphibian Aquanauts. Radish Run was the winding path used for the annual “Hop to the Top” race, held every May 10th. Turnip Tower was the tallest mound in Willowbrook, crowned by a weather-beaten mailbox with no known owner. Mushroom Market was the underground trading post where hedgehogs, mice, and the occasional squirrel gathered every Saturday evening to barter for acorns, seeds, and exotic cheeses.

Reginald’s closest companion was Lila, a field mouse with a knack for origami and a mysterious past involving a traveling circus. Lila had a secret code name (“Agent Cheddar”) and a collection of tiny hats for every occasion. There was also Sir Fluffles, a retired show-pony from nearby Dandelion Downs, who only eats golden oats and wears a red feather in his mane on Sundays. Sir Fluffles claims to have once raced against a tortoise and lost, but insists it was “wind resistance.” He provided occasional transport when Reginald needed to travel incognito.

There was the notorious Mayor Clucksworth, the self-proclaimed chicken mayor of Willowbrook Farm, whose strict policies on vegetable consumption made him a constant thorn in Reginald’s side. Mayor Clucksworth had once banned all turnips, calling them “suspiciously shaped.” His campaign slogan was, “A Turnip Saved is a Turnip Earned.” Mayor Clucksworth lives in the grand Rooster Hall near Turnip Tower, holds weekly town meetings at 7:07 a.m. on Thursdays.

Other neighbors included Professor Puddlefoot, an eccentric duck inventor from Parsley Pond, who claims to have built a flying boat powered by laughter. Lady Whiskerton, the Jenkins’ cat and president of the Willowbrook Feline Society, is undefeated in cheese-rolling contests. Captain Beaky, the Jenkins’ parrot, once sailed with the legendary “Pirate Pigeon Pete” and has a tattoo of a sunflower on his left wing. Captain Beaky can say “Pizza delivery!” in six languages and is known to gossip about everyone’s business. Rufus the dog is secretly an aspiring poet. His poetry collection, “Barks and Sonnets,” is read by candlelight in the Hedgehog Library every full moon.

The story really takes off with the infamous Great Pizza Heist. On May 23, 2023, Reginald first hears about the pizza party while nibbling on clover at noon. At 5:00 p.m., Lila decodes the pigeon message while sipping acorn tea. At 8:17 p.m., Sir Fluffles is spotted practicing ballet behind Turnip Tower. At 11:59 p.m., Reginald, Lila, and Sir Fluffles don disguises and meet at the haunted scarecrow, which wears a hat adorned with glow-in-the-dark beetles. At precisely midnight, Reginald, Lila, and Sir Fluffles met behind the old scarecrow, whose hat was rumored to be haunted by the ghost of a tomato. Using the password “Squeaky Wheel,” they intercepted the pizza delivery from Signor Giuseppe, Willowbrook’s only Italian hedgehog chef. “Grazie mille!” Reginald said, bowing deeply, having learned some Italian from a box of spaghetti. They stashed the pizza under a wheelbarrow, but disaster struck! The Jenkins’ cat, Lady Whiskerton, known for her ninja-like agility and love of cheese, discovered the stash. A tense negotiation ensued, which ended in a truce: Lady Whiskerton would get the anchovies, but Reginald would get first dibs on the pineapple. This historic agreement would later be known as “The Treaty of Wheelbarrow.” At 12:15 a.m., the group escapes, narrowly missing Farmer Jenkins, who is distracted by a rogue raccoon in his shed.

Other notable events and fun facts: Reginald once entered the Willowbrook Annual Vegetable Sculpting Contest under the pseudonym “Regina Lettuce,” and sculpted a bust of himself entirely out of rutabagas. He placed second, losing to a zucchini giraffe. Lila’s favorite origami creation was a tiny replica of the Burrow of Bumberscratch, which she gifted to Reginald as a lucky charm. The haunted scarecrow is said to whisper advice on rainy nights, mostly gardening tips. Reginald is allergic to Brussels sprouts, which makes his ears wiggle uncontrollably. The Zucchini Uprising of 2018 saw rabbits led by Cousin Hazel stage a protest after Mayor Clucksworth raised the vegetable tax. The Great Lettuce Flood of 2019, when Lettuce Lake overflowed, created a temporary “water slide” that was used for three glorious days. Sir Fluffles’ record for the longest jump over Parsley Pond was 1.25 meters, set on August 14, 2021. Professor Puddlefoot’s flying boat was briefly airborne for three minutes and sixteen seconds before crash-landing in a pumpkin patch. Reginald’s carrot cake incident got him banned from the Willowbrook Bake-Off for using “explosive yeast” that launched his carrot cake into the next county.

Other notable locations include Sunbeam Square, the sunniest spot in Willowbrook where everyone naps on Tuesdays; the Secret Tunnel of Sprout Street, only accessible if you know the password (“Rutabaga Rumble”); Mossy Maple Woods, home to firefly festivals every June with live music by the Beetle Band; and the Hedgehog Library, built from stacked seed catalogs and open 24 hours on leap years.

Rabbit lore and traditions: On Leap Years, all rabbits wear hats made of leaves and participate in the Midnight Dance of the Dewdrops. The legendary “Golden Parsnip” is said to grant one wish to whoever finds it—last rumored seen in Snailstone Hill in 2020. Reginald once invented “pizza yoga,” combining stretches and bites, now a craze among local rabbits. Every winter, Reginald and Lila host the “Snowflake Shuffle,” a sled race down Radish Run.

Now, whenever there’s a pizza party in Willowbrook, an extra slice is left by the haunted scarecrow at midnight—just in case Reginald, Lila, and Sir Fluffles decide to grace the gathering. Some say you can still hear their laughter echoing through the Mossy Maple Woods, especially if the moon is full and there’s a whiff of cheese on the breeze.

And thus, the legend of Reginald Thistlewhiskers grows—one adventure, one friend, and one slice of pizza at a time.
